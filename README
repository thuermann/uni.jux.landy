This is an extremely simple interpreter written for a JuX[1] talk
about Lex and Yacc on 17 Nov 1994.  To concentrate on usage of the
parser and scanner generator tools, the interpreter only supports
evaluation of statements and expressions, only one data type (double),
no scopes, no function definitions, and does not perform full error
checking.

[1] JuX (Joviale Unterweisung in Unix) is a series of talks about Unix
    and related topics, organized by Martin Neitzel at the Technical
    University of Braunschweig.
